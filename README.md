Objective:

This project replicates the key findings of Card & Krueger (1994), “Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.”
The goal is to reproduce the employment effects using the public dataset (public.dat) and compare results to those reported in the original paper.

Folder Structure:

code/ – Python scripts for data prep and analysis
data/ – Raw and cleaned data files
output/ – Regression output in text format
environment.txt – List of installed packages

How to Run:

python code/build_minimal_csv.py
python code/run.py
python code/run_extension.py

Outputs:

data/minimal.csv – Clean dataset used for baseline replication
output/results.txt – Contains regression results for:
ΔFTE ~ NJ
ΔFTE ~ GAP
data/extension.csv - Dataset used for the extension analysis
output/results_extension.txt – Contains regression results for:
Symmetric percent change in FTE ~ NJ
Symmetric percent change in FTE ~ GAP

Key Results:

Model: ΔFTE ~ NJ Coefficient: +2.75 p-value: 0.04 Interpretation: NJ restaurants increased employment relative to PA

Model: ΔFTE ~ GAP Coefficient: +16.36 p-value: 0.006 Interpretation: Firms most affected by the wage increase had higher employment growth

These results support Card & Krueger’s central conclusion:
“The 1992 New Jersey minimum wage increase did not reduce employment — and may have increased it slightly.”

Extension Description: 
The extension evaluates robustness by replacing the level change in employment with the symmetric percent change in full-time equivalent employment:
pchg_fte = 2(FTE2 − FTE1) / (FTE2 + FTE1)
This alternative outcome measure accounts for differences in restaurant size and focuses on proportional employment adjustments. The extension uses the same differences-in-differences framework and treatment definitions as the baseline analysis.

Extension Results
Extension Model: pchg_fte ~ NJ
The estimated coefficient is positive but not statistically significant, indicating no evidence of negative employment effects when employment changes are measured proportionally.

Extension Model: pchg_fte ~ GAP
The estimated coefficient is also positive but not statistically significant, suggesting that larger minimum wage increases are not associated with employment declines under the alternative outcome definition.

Overall, the extension reinforces the baseline conclusion and demonstrates robustness to alternative modeling choices.

Replication Notes:

Minor cleaning adjustments were made to handle missing values.
Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust (HC1).
Results are consistent in magnitude and direction with the original study.
This project provided practical experience replicating a well-known study in labor economics

Environment:

The file environment.txt includes the Python version and required packages to ensure reproducibility.
